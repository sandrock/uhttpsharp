## In this branch

A few changes I'm making for another project:

* Allow multiple instances (on multiple TCP/IP ports)
* Allow bit of IoC
* Use lambdas to define routes
* Convert the HttpHandler class to a IHttpHandler interface
* Create a HttpContext class to simplify IHttpHandler

__Source code is not usable at this time (compile errors).__
